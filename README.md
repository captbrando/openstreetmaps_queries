# OpenStreetMaps Queries

This is going to be a collection of Overpass API scripts that I write to find things. I started with the three videos that [Jose Monkey](https://www.tiktok.com/@the_josemonkey?lang=en) posted asking for people to find him. Those videos are:

1. [First Challenge](https://www.tiktok.com/@the_josemonkey/video/7239319639803645226?lang=en)
2. [Second Challenge](https://www.tiktok.com/@the_josemonkey/video/7267141754137136426?lang=en)
3. [Third Challenge](https://www.tiktok.com/@the_josemonkey/video/7357056633047911723?lang=en)

Mostly I'm trying to learn OverPassQL as something fun to do. I've learned a LOT in the last few days, including that a lot of the data in OpenStreetMaps is questionable at best. More populated areas tend to have better data, less populated areas is not as great. I'm also considering toying with some ways to feed the database based on some queries I am working on (and will publish later). 

Overall a fun project!
